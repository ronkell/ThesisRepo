1. in functions prune_after_action,make_new_root i made changes that we wont have pruning
2. i add id to make sure that there are no pruning.
3. change so the new root is updated and not making new root

Notes:
1. after we have MCTS tree we want to expand obs nodes we didnt see in the POMCP there are 2 cases:
    * after an action we dont have all the availbe obs nodes, because the black box didnt roll it up
    * we have more than one obs child for action node and now we need to expand the obs nodes that we didnt expand in pomcp
after expanding the new nodes maybe need to expand newer ones if added.
what i do with the new ones? because this proccess can be for eternal.

2. i added more smart rollout need to check that its ok.

3.for the real state in the expand  ronen says to take state from the belief state in the node.

4. add penalty to actions

5. 



TODO:

2.need to fix context so its context only if the sate changes from trace in time 1 to trace in time 2





Done:
1. add adapter from problem to POMCP so POMCP knows only numbers and promblems know states
and the adapter shift between the two with maps for number to state and another one mapping state to number
add only when encouter new state so you dont need to save all state space

2. need to check if i can prune after taking action but only the actions that were not taken
like if i have a tree
        r
       /  \
    a1      a2
           /   \
          o1    o2    and we are choosing a2 and o1  we prune only  a1 so we get

        r
          \
            a2
           /   \
          o1    o2
